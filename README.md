# Instructional Thing

## Part I

> Make a small tutorial or instructional "thing" that could be understood by someone who doesn't speak English. Use any medium/materials/style you want, *other* than a web page: crayon drawing, [aircraft safety card](https://www.google.com/search?q=aircraft+safety+card&tbm=isch), origami, Lego diorama, [IKEA-style manual](http://www.ikea.com/ms/en_US/customer_service/assembly_instructions.html), etc.

My idea is for a Zoetrope that stands at eye-level at the entry way/s of a park,
or recreational area.

When you use a Zoetrope there are sometimes different inserts, which you can
slide into the machine to experience different "movies."

Parks are for relaxing, and great places to visit when you are traveling
(I had 24 hours in Tokyo and spent almost the entire time in Yoyogi Park).
BUT,  there are often still a few things you need to know when you enter the
park - like where to dispose of your dog's poop, how to use the coin-operated
binoculars, or how to navigate to each of the trash cans.

Each paper insert (probably lamented or special material for protection from
  the rain/snow) could show a different tutorial and would not require any text.
An illustration of coin-op binoculars various parts, for instance, could be
broken up into discrete frames with arrows or hands on different parts,
then lined up on one of the inserts for a zoetroped
tutorial!


## Part II

> Take the [first week's](https://github.com/bfl-itp/syllabus/blob/master/schedule.md#sep-4) offline Instructional Thing assignment online. Reimagine it for (and take advantage of) the new medium. For example: if Part I was a stop-frame animation, Part II might be a slideshow where the user can click between the steps.

*Describe your project here â€“ explain the evolution, and what was gained
and lost from using this new medium*

At first I did not see the "point" of creating an online component, since
people do not typically visit park websites for rules, maps, or tutorials
before visiting a park. I did see an opportunity, however, for in-park
creativity, and for that creativity to create a kind of shared knowledge
community, or least creative social media space for/about the park.

QR codes could be placed in discreet places near the equipment/objects the
visitors learned about when entering the park (i.e. the lessons from the
instructional zoetrope). These QR Codes could enable the visitors to download
an app to "zoetrope" their photos.

To illustrate the concept, I found a clip of a father teaching his son how to use
coin-operated binoculars, took a few dozen screen shots of the video, and made
a few kinds of old-timey movies the app could generate - 1 zopetroped stop motion,
and the other an old-timey silent film, which I made by transcribing their
dialoge, making the stills black + white, and adding Scott Joplin ragtime music.

I places the movies in a mock iPhone interface to show how the app would look/work.
Lastly I found a park website and replaced the main image under the news section
with one of the movies, to show how visitor's movies could be uploaded to the 
park website in real-time.
