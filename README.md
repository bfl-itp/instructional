# Instructional Thing

## Part I

> Make a small tutorial or instructional "thing" that could be understood by someone who doesn't speak English. Use any medium/materials/style you want, *other* than a web page: crayon drawing, [aircraft safety card](https://www.google.com/search?q=aircraft+safety+card&tbm=isch), origami, Lego diorama, [IKEA-style manual](http://www.ikea.com/ms/en_US/customer_service/assembly_instructions.html), etc.

*Describe your project here*

## Part II

> Take the [first week's](https://github.com/bfl-itp/syllabus/blob/master/schedule.md#sep-4) offline Instructional Thing assignment online. Reimagine it for (and take advantage of) the new medium.

*Describe your project here â€“ explain the evolution*

The idea for this project began as a stop motion animation/timelapse video instructional for hand casting. I set up both a video camera and a camera shooting frames every 5 seconds, imagining that the process could speak for itself, because it is very visual. I soon learned that it's difficult to document such an intensive process without an extra set of hands and without a well thought out shot plan/storyboard for imperative, key shots to explain the process. So, I was left with gigabytes worth of documentation content, but a lot of it involved motion blurred images. And, I learned that simply documenting a process (even if it is quite visual) isn't sufficient. It's important to think of key steps in a process and key information that could easily be translated visually (for example, measurements of ingredients).

This web version of the process pairs down the process to key steps, includes short copy to support the visuals as well as links to learn more about and purchase materials.

Here are some photos of my process:
