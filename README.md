# Instructional Thing

## Part I

> Make a small tutorial or instructional "thing" that could be understood by someone who doesn't speak English. Use any medium/materials/style you want, *other* than a web page: crayon drawing, [aircraft safety card](https://www.google.com/search?q=aircraft+safety+card&tbm=isch), origami, Lego diorama, [IKEA-style manual](http://www.ikea.com/ms/en_US/customer_service/assembly_instructions.html), etc.

## Part II

> Take the [first week's](https://github.com/bfl-itp/syllab#sep-4us/blob/master/schedule.md) offline Instructional Thing assignment online. Reimagine it for (and take advantage of) the new medium.

*Describe your project here â€“ explain the evolution*
