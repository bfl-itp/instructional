# Instructional Thing

## Part I

> Make a small tutorial or instructional "thing" that could be understood by someone who doesn't speak English. Use any medium/materials/style you want, *other* than a web page: crayon drawing, [aircraft safety card](https://www.google.com/search?q=aircraft+safety+card&tbm=isch), origami, Lego diorama, [IKEA-style manual](http://www.ikea.com/ms/en_US/customer_service/assembly_instructions.html), etc.

Please see my gif UX animation for "mama knows the best"mobile application.
here <https://reginahjm.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/mama_interaction.gif>  
This is a concept design app for guiding people to a healthier food choice. 
We built a character, "mama" which allows users to ask and get feedback on their choices.
 


## Part II

> Take the [first week's](https://github.com/bfl-itp/syllabus/blob/master/schedule.md#sep-4) offline Instructional Thing assignment online. Reimagine it for (and take advantage of) the new medium. For example: if Part I was a stop-frame animation, Part II might be a slideshow where the user can click between the steps.

I created the tabs and each tab describes the steps, how to use the application. 
This process also helped me to understand the application better and how I wanted to design it. 
I was more able to explain the process better by diving the steps.
